# FAIRtracks validation tools

Originally, validation tools were available in this repository. They
have since been moved to 
[their own repository](https://github.com/fairtracks/fairtracks_validator/),
so that dependency and package management is simplified.

The FAIRtracks validation tools are available at:

https://github.com/fairtracks/fairtracks_validator/
